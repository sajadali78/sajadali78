# About Me
Final year student of Bachelor of Electrical Engineering (Power) at Sukkur IBA University, I have done different projects throughout six semesters. The skills I got from these projects are: Teamwork, time management, division of work in equal portions, presentation and communication skills, moreover the most important for any engineer are technical skills, I got are Basic Electrical Engineering knowledge (wiring, solution for complex circuits), programming of Matlab and basics of control systems design on LabVIEW, power systems and their analysis which helped to polish my simulation skills in Simulink and PSSE, I am knowledgeable about electrical machines (Transformers, synchronous machines, induction machines, and DC machines) too. Apart from academia, I have an interest in reading literature. My favorite authors are Faiz Ahmed Faiz, Elif Shafak, and Shaikh Ayaz. I also like to visit Govt: schools to share knowledge and motivate students for higher studies.
